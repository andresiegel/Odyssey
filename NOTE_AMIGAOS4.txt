Please _NO_ other-browser release-forks!

You can't just change a few bits there, and release another "some_browser". By doing this you kill all motivation to continue working on.
WebKit is free, but all Amiga (GUI and stuff) specific code there are hard work of some peoples (Fab, Joerg, DeadWood, Daniel_onyxsoft & Kas1e), who do not want situations when a source is taken, some things changed,
and released like some other browser with some other name. So please respect that even if you didn't like.

If you wish to fix and improve things there, all should be put back to that repo, so later another version of Odyssey can be released.

All help appreciated, be it pull-request, patches, forum topics or whatever, but please no release-forks of Odyssey, calling it "somename_Odyssey" or "some_other_browser". If you wish your own
browser and control how things should be done, just take WebKit source code and do whatever you want with taking those amiga-specific parts from Odyssey as reference.

And of course, it is absolutely not allowed to take that code, and making commercial releases of all sorts, be it Enhancer, OS4, or whatever else.

Probably there weren't big needs to explain an obvious, but just in case someone will find the idea of taking it all, changing a name, few bits with build date and made another "browser" as something worthy. So please NO. Thanks!
